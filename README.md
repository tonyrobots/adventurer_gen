  <br>
</h1>

This is a [Phaser 3](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser) starter with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org) with ⚡️ lightning fast HMR through [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).

## Available Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `yarn install` | Install project dependencies |
| `yarn dev` | Builds project and open web server, watching for changes |
| `yarn build` | Builds code bundle with production settings  |
| `yarn serve` | Run a web server to serve built code bundle |

<b>Note: had problems with yarn trying to get things running on heroku, so using npm instead. use `npm run dev` for local dev server</b>


## Development

After cloning the repo, run `yarn install` from your project directory. Then, you can start the local development
server by running `yarn dev` and navigate to http://localhost:3000.

## Production

After running `yarn build`, the files you need for production will be on the `dist` folder. To test code on your `dist` folder, run `yarn serve` and navigate to http://localhost:5000
